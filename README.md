Globally, there has been an increase in the attainment of gym memberships, and the emphasis on fitness routines and health coaching has far surpassed ever before. However, as more people utilize the gym for their daily exercises, proper form, correct and safe equipment usage has become significantly vital for an overall successful fitness experience.
According to the National Safety Council (NSC), in 2019 “personal exercise, with or without exercise equipment, accounted for about 468,000 injuries below the category of exercise and exercise equipment”
Fitness instructors cite the following reason for gym-related injuries:
Inattention due to cell phones or other distractions.
Using equipment for the first time without proper instruction
Working out too hard, too soon after a period of inactivity.

While personal trainers are available, they remain an expensive option. Moreover, most people are already committed to gym membership payments that personal trainers may be economically overwhelming. Your Gym Guide app acts as a portable gym partner.

Purpose -
Decrease gym injuries by indicating the proper form and technique of gym equipment and machines
Ease overall gym-intimidation by providing a personal gym companion 
Provide information on the different types of equipment and their uses.

Target Users - 
This app is for men and women who care about their health and would like to try working out in the gym regardless of fitness level and ability.

How to Use Your Gym Guide - 
Select your avatar, then point your phone camera onto the user guide image usually located on the side of the gym machine. Once the gym equipment is recognized by the application, you will be directed to a page with information on the machine and the application’s recommended workouts. Read the information provided about the equipment and select the type of exercise you are willing to do on that piece of equipment. Browse through the front, back, and side previews using the “next preview” button. Follow the avatar's movements for a safe exercise routine. Once you have completed the exercise you may choose between returning to the Camera and directing it to another equipment to perform the next exercise or you may exit through the exit button.

Features:
-Useful description on the equipment
- Information on proper workout posture
- Detailed animation guide
- Recommended workouts based on equipment detected

How does Your Gym Guide work-
According to your character selection, our algorithm will generate an avatar that performs  the exercise movements with proper form based on the user guide image you direct your camera toward. The user guide image is usually located on the side of the gym equipment. The user guide image usually provides a brief description of the muscles targeted by the equipment and has a picture of the equipment on it. Below is an example of the user guide image on one of the NYUAD gym equipment.
